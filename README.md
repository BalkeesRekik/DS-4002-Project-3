# Chest X-Ray Image Classification (DS 4002 Project 3)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project applies image classification using a pre-trained EfficientNetV2S model to distinguish between **normal** and **pneumonia** chest X-ray images. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, and a transfer learning approach is used to improve performance with limited computational resources.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Classify chest X-rays as either **normal** or **pneumonia**
- Fine-tune a pre-trained CNN to maximize performance
- Evaluate the model using precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score

## ðŸ§  Model

**EfficientNetV2S**
- Epochs: Set to 30, **stopped early at 21** using early stopping
- Fine-tuned base model (after initial training)

## ðŸ“Š Performance Summary (on Test Set)

| Metric        | Value    |
|---------------|----------|
| Accuracy      | **93.4%** âœ… |
| Normal Recall | 88.0% |
| Pneumonia Recall | 96.7% |
| F1 Score (Avg) | ~92.9% |
